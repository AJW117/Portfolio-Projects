    <p><br><br>1.	What is authentication? Why is authentication important in computer security?
        A: Method of proving the identity, its usually something a person is, has, or does. Use of biometrics, passwords, passphrase, token, or other private information.To be properly authenticated, the subject is usually required to provide a second piece to the credential set (i.e., password, passphrase, key, PIN, token etc).
        </p>
        <p>2.	What is authorization? Give a real life example of the use of authorization.
            A: There are 3 primary authentication methods. Sensitive or critical information should be protected by employing at least two of them (two-or three-factor  authentication). 
            -Knowledge-Something you know, such as a password, passphrase or PIN.
            -Ownership-For example, tokens and Smart cards.
            -Characteristics-Biometrics are digitized representations of physical features (such as fingerprints) or physical actions (such as signatures).
            </p>
        <p>3.  There is no need for authorization. The UI for normal user will not have the options to perform actions intended for the admin users” Do you agree?
            A:
            
            </p>
        <p>4.	are the primary methods for authentication?
            A: There are 3 primary authentication methods. Sensitive or critical information should be protected by employing at least two of them (two-or three-factor  authentication). 
           1.	What Knowledge-Something you know, such as a password, passphrase or PIN.
           2.	Ownership-For example, tokens and Smart cards.
           3.	Characteristics-Biometrics are digitized representations of physical features (such as fingerprints) or physical actions (such as signatures).
           
           </p>
        <P>5.	Give an example of biometric authentication you use everyday. Comment on its false positives and false negative rates. 
            A: Face ID is a biometric I use everyday, typically in dark rooms or odd angles it fails to authenticate my identity adding to the false rejection rate. There are a few times where a family member has used a biometric to unlock my phone and managed to bypass adding to the false acceptance rate
            </P>
        <p>6.	What is crossover error rate?
            A:
            </p>
        <p>7.	“To have better biometric authentication, it is better to have highly sensitive equipments” comment on this. 
            A: I believe that having overly sensitive equipment makes it easier to 
            </p>
        <P>8.	“Humans are the weakest links of any system”. Do you agree? Give an example where this holds true, and give an example where this does not.
            A: Yes and No, due to the predictability of humans, it's quit simple to guess a password,as humans we tend to make passwords that are easy for us to remember and or different variations of the same passwords.
            
            </P>
        <p>9.	Briefly describe the different ways an attacker can try to gain access to your gmail account.
            A: "One-Time Password." A one-time password is a unique code that is generated for a single use and is typically valid only for a short period of time. Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.
            </p>
        <p>10.	Is it a good idea to use the same password everywhere? Why or why not?
            A:  No, it makes it easier for hackers to guees the passwords and give them accesss to other websites/ applications with personal data.
            </p>
        <p>11.	List situations where bruteforce attack to guess a password may be successful, and where it won’t.
            A: For instance, attackers can try to hack your Facebook by using a program to try and guess millions of passwords against your username. This is the most basic form of attack and is often the most difficult one to pull off. It is easy to defend against too. Most systems have measures in place to prevent brute force attacks. 
            </p>
        <p>12.	Why do bruteforce attacks take so long?
            	A: an attacker who does not know the decryption key attempts to determine the key by making millions or billions of guesses. There are over 6.6 quadrillion possible 8-character passwords using this character set. Keep in mind, this assumes that all possible combinations of characters are allowed, and that the password doesn't have any additional rules or restrictions.
